Just a comment about the remote activation packet :

Metered Lane Actions (default should be 6)
        1 - Rest in Dark
        2 - Rest in Green
        3 - Fixed Rate
        4 - Traffic Responsive
        6 - Skip (Normal Case)
        7 - Slave Responsive (slave data being used from a master
controller)

Metered Lane  Release Rate in VPH (MSB) (default should be 0x03)
Metered Lane  Release Rate in VPH (LSB)  (default should be 0x84)
Metered Lane  Plan Number   (default should be 0x1)

Essentially the default is: Action = Skip to Time of Day, VPH = 900 , Plan
= 1

The URMS can handle many messages. Most of these are in support of legacy
170 ramp metering programs such as TOS, SDRMS, SATAMS and OCRMS.

In this case we are actually emulating a SDRMS SET packet at address
0x7001.

As such, the checksum in a simple additive 8 bit checksum of bytes 0 to 20
