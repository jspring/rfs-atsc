In the /f0 directory there is a file named "startup"

This file tell the controller what to do when it starts up (ie. run TSCP or
the URMS)

Within each of the URMS and TSCP folders there is also a copy of the
startup script.

Basicly to change it to a TSCP controller from a URMS controller

   1.  chd /f0
   2. rename startup URMSstartup
   3. copy tscp/startup startup
   4. break

Sometimes I have a little more problems when the TSCP is installed because
that application does not always allow renaming the startup file while the
program is being run.
