# This configuration file specifies the fixed geographic information
# that needs to be sent out with each intersection broadcast message,
# as well as the phase number associated with each approach that will
# be used to determine what countdown information belongs with each approach.
# See ix_format_2006_627.xls for more information about the data types.
# Format for this file is lines beginning with # are comments
# (Read in file with fgets and ignore these).
# Number of items in any list are given before the list, for ease
# in reading in the file.

# Intersection ID (string of 4 characters, not sure if DCX wants integer)

# For each approach, phase number, number of stop lines, and leftmost point
# latitude, longitude, length and orientation for each of the stop lines (in
# this case, as in most cases, only 1. The phase numbers and their timing
# for the RFS intersection are described in rfs.phases.cfg.

# These values aren't correct because I don't have RFS intersection GPS
# coordinates yet and I don't have a good feel for how big a lane is in
# (lat,long) degrees, but I've tried to set up the orientation and phase
# numbers to be sort of reasonable, if the intersection were exactly
# aligned NSEW, degrees were symmetric (which they aren't) and a lane
# were about 5*10^-7 degrees wide, and 4 meters wide.
