# This configuration file specifies the fixed geographic information
# that needs to be sent out with each intersection broadcast message,
# as well as the phase number associated with each approach that will
# be used to determine what countdown information belongs with each approach.
# See ix_format_2006_627.xls for more information about the data types.
# Format for this file is lines beginning with # are comments
# (Read in file with fgets and ignore these).
# Number of items in any list are given before the list, for ease
# in reading in the file.
#
# Intersection ID (string of 4 characters, not sure if DCX wants integer)
2
# Map Node ID (string of 4 characters, not sure if DCX wants integer)

# In following, latitude and longitude are in 10 ^-7 decimal degress signed,
# altitude in meters above sea level.
#
# Latitude, longitude, altitude of center of intersection 
374250740 -1221458470 10
# Latitude, longitude, altitude of antenna
374249420 -122146044 20
# Number of approaches
8
# For each approach, phase number, number of stop lines, and leftmost point
# latitude, longitude, length and orientation for each of the stop lines (in
# this case, as in most cases, only 1). The phase numbers and their timing
# for the California intersection are described in cal.phases.cfg.
#
# In following, latitude and longitude are in 10 ^-7 decimal degress signed,
# length of stop line in centimeters and orientation in degrees.
