To build the code in this distribution, go to the ix subdirectory. 

% cd ix
% make
% make install

To test both the Intersection Message set send and receive code in this
distribution, cd to the test directory, do 

% cp snd_test_phases.in.rfs snd_test_phases.in

and run

% test_only.sh

See comments in the above script and in the source code in the ix
directory.
 
The output of the script will be a countdown of the phases at the
RFS intersection, for a particular input trace that was taken by PATH.  
Input files created from other signal phase traces
will be added to the distribution as testing is continued.
