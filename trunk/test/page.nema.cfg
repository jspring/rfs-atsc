# This configuration file assigns the bit positions in the digital I/O
# to the NEMA phases, in case of a sniffer installation.
# It codifies how the intersection was actually wired, ie which probe
# from the sniffer board was actually placed on what signal wire.
#
# Number of bits
8
# For each bit, phase color (G, Y or R) and phase number.
# Each element below corresponds to the digital bit number that will be 0
# when that phase has that color.
