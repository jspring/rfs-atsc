# The first entry in this file is the number of distinct timings for traffic
# movements, which following the practice of traffic signal controller
# documentation I am calling phases. 
8
# Phases are specified by integers, the NEMA standard basic movements are
# numbered 1-8, but complicated intersections may have more phases
#
# The second entry in this file is the number of timing plans. California
# and El Camino has 4 active timing plans, 3 coordinated and 1 actuated.
# (but so far I have only managed to figure out two...)
2
#
# This will be followed by a set of lines for each timing plan. 
# The first line of each timing plan will give a code for the type of
# timing (which # will be 0 for fixed, 1 for actuated, and 2 for coordinated),
# and for coordinated plans, the number of the final phase (whose end signals
# the zero point of the cycle) and the total length of the cycle (these
# will probably not be used for actuated or fixed plans). 
#
# Then for each phase there will be a line with the offset within the
# total cycle of the start of the green interval for that phase, the length
# of the green interval, the length of the yellow interval (which may be
# specified to tenths of a second) and the length of the all-red interval.  
# If the signal is actuated we will for now just enter the offset and
# green interval each as -1, but will specify the yellow and all-red interval
# that follow each green phase. 
#
# The phases will be listed within each timing plan in the order in which
# they become active within that timing plan; phases that become active
# at the same time will be listed in arbitrary order.
#
# For coordinated plans, the length of the green interval allows the
# calculation of the force-off point, but it is possible that some phases
# may end earlier than this, or start earlier than their offset.
#
# For California Plan 1 is (coordinated, final phase 6, cycle 130)

# Finally the config file includes the definition of parent and omit

# Then we have one line for each overlap, including the phase number

# 8 phases), the parent phases and the omit phases (we will assume 2 parent
# phases and 2 omit phases for now, to fill up as phase 0 if only one phase).
